                    <p>Quick update, I have just added web support for Shrek's Swamp (see below). Although the web version GUI is clipping out of the screen slightly, it's fully playable. If you dont like that, then download the game on the downloads page.</p>

                    <p>Hi guys, I have just made a new game that you can now check out right on the games page. It is called Shrek's Swamp, and it currently doesn't have a web build (you have to download it), but I'll add a web version soon!</p>
